GoToSpec
========

<div style="margin:auto;text-align:center"><img src="http://fcoury.info/GoToSpec.gif"></div>

This is an early stage RSpec helper plugin for Sublime Text 2.

Currently it just jumps between the file being edited and it's spec (and back) using Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Go to your `Packages` folder and clone the repo, usually:

    cd "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages"
    git clone https://github.com/webbynode/GoToSpec.git GoToSpec
